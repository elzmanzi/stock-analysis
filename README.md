# stock-analysis Project Using Visual Basics for Application-VBA

## Overview of Project

In this project we are analyzing stock data using Visual Basics for Application(VBA). We will mainly focus on the total daily volume, 
yearly return for each stock. We calculated the total daily volume based on total number of shares traded throughout the day; it measures how actively a stock is traded. The yearly return is the percentage difference in starting and ending price from the beginning of year till it's end. 

### Analysis And Summary

#### Analysis : 

##### Results

In 2018 only __ENPH__ and __RUN__ stocks did well through out the year with a return over 80 percent comparing to the rest stocks.

By observing the numbers below for  2017 returns ,  all stock we realize that there is many stocks which has high performance  like DQ, ENPH, FSLR, SEDG comparing to the year of 2018. They performed over 100%.

*DQ and ENPH has high performance and if someone is looking to invest, it is worth  putting both DQ and ENPH into consideration*.

Refactoring codes helps in reducing the run time, by running 2017 stock analysis before and after refactoring the codes , I went from 1.03 to 0.08 ms. This is a significant difference, depending on the size and scope of your solution it might be worth.

#### Summary:

 In a summary statement, address the following questions.

What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

* Refactoring the codes reduces the running time,
* it uses few lines, 
* removes duplicates, 
* easier to read,
* It makes your codes looks cleaner and makes it easier for future iteration.

How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

* Refactoring original VBA script, I was able to remove unnecessary lines and duplicates. 
* I used more loops to loop over my codes instead of repeating my codes.
* On the other hand, If refactoring is not performed well, it may result in breaking the previous working codes, and high chance of introducing more bugs. 
* In addition, refactoring can be quite time-consuming.
